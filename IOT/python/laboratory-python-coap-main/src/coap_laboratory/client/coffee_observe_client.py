# For this laboratory we rely on the aiocoap library (0.4.x) - https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap
# Dependencies are managed with uv. From the project root run: uv run coffee-observe-client
#
# Test client observing the Coffee Actuator (/coffee): it registers as observer (GET with Observe = 0)
# and prints a notification every time a new coffee is made (e.g., with coffee-post-client or coffee-put-client
# in another terminal). Stop the client with CTRL+C.
